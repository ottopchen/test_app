Beautiful gated community with underground parking. Registered with City of Palm Springs (Transient Occupancy License (PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN)) Downtown Palm Springs so you can walk to shops, restaurants, cafes and bars, nightlife and theatre. Very cute, efficient condo / apartment in a really elegantly beautiful gated community. There is one bedroom with a king bed, two full bathrooms, open living/dining/kitchen area opening to a patio. Very private, three swimming pools, two tennis courts, small gym, lots of subterranean parking. Wi-Fi and cable TV. Across from Agua Caliente casino and Palm Springs Convention Center. This is a great place for a lot of privacy but walking distance to everything downtown. I list this as sleeping two people, but there is also a queen sized sofa bed which is only OK for kids or people who aren't particular about comfort. All linens included. Very clean and neat here. Two night minimum stay please.In the area enjoy high end shopping at El Paseo in Palm Desert, The Palm Springs Tramway up the mountain, Joshua Tree National Park, Modern- Mid Century architecture, Indian Wells tennis garden. Fly into Palm Springs International or 2 hours drive to LA, Orange County, San DIego.

Floors are cool fifties style polished concrete with stunning Warhol and Slim Aarons prints decorating the walls.All modern touches and comforts are also at hand. The interior is 100 air-conditioned and the kitchen is equipped with all extras like coffee-maker, ice machine, electric juice press, food processor and Nutribullet. Bedrooms have super-comfortable mattresses, high thread count linens, quality bedding and loads of wardrobe space.

It is even featured on local design week tours and was constructed in 1958 by the renowned team of Alexander Co, designer William Krisel with gardens by William Kopelk.The authentic and stylish interior features iconic pieces, many original, from designers like Eero Saarinen, Charles Eames, Louis Poulsen and Harry Bertoia. Floors are cool fifties style polished concrete with stunning Warhol and Slim Aarons prints decorating the walls.All modern touches and comforts are also at hand. The interior is 100 air-conditioned and the kitchen is equipped with all extras like coffee-maker, ice machine, electric juice press, food processor and Nutribullet. Bedrooms have super-comfortable mattresses, high thread count linens, quality bedding and loads of wardrobe space. The TV room has a Samsung 55' flat screen with Time Warner cable unlimited wifi.The lovely gardens with their mountain views have been re-designed and restored by William Kopelk, who also was responsible for the famous Mid-Century gardens of Neutra's Kaufmann House (and is President of The Palm Spings Preservation Assn). Designed in low-irrigation desert style there is a small grassed area with lemon trees at the rear, fire pit and BBQ. The pool is heated and is totally private.An outdoor covered patio has comfortable seating, also has mountain views and overlooks the pool and gardens.

It is even featured on local design week tours and was constructed in 1958 by the renowned team of Alexander Co, designer William Krisel with gardens by William Kopelk.The authentic and stylish interior features iconic pieces, many original, from designers like Eero Saarinen, Charles Eames, Louis Poulsen and Harry Bertoia. Floors are cool fifties style polished concrete with stunning Warhol and Slim Aarons prints decorating the walls.All modern touches and comforts are also at hand. The interior is 100 air-conditioned and the kitchen is equipped with all extras like coffee-maker, ice machine, electric juice press, food processor and Nutribullet. Bedrooms have super-comfortable mattresses, high thread count linens, quality bedding and loads of wardrobe space. The TV room has a Samsung 55' flat screen with Time Warner cable unlimited wifi.The lovely gardens with their mountain views have been re-designed and restored by William Kopelk, who also was responsible for the famous Mid-Century gardens of Neutra's Kaufmann House (and is President of The Palm Spings Preservation Assn). Designed in low-irrigation desert style there is a small grassed area with lemon trees at the rear, fire pit and BBQ. The pool is heated and is totally private.An outdoor covered patio has comfortable seating, also has mountain views and overlooks the pool and gardens. Within walking distance of the famous design district and just a mile from downtown the location is excellent. Take a stroll - or cycle on your own complimentary bikes - around the local streets for a mini-modernism tour of the wonderful mid-century modern homes of the Racquet Club Estates.

Floors are cool fifties style polished concrete with stunning Warhol and Slim Aarons prints decorating the walls.All modern touches and comforts are also at hand. The interior is 100 air-conditioned and the kitchen is equipped with all extras like coffee-maker, ice machine, electric juice press, food processor and Nutribullet. Bedrooms have super-comfortable mattresses, high thread count linens, quality bedding and loads of wardrobe space. The TV room has a Samsung 55' flat screen with Time Warner cable unlimited wifi.The lovely gardens with their mountain views have been re-designed and restored by William Kopelk, who also was responsible for the famous Mid-Century gardens of Neutra's Kaufmann House (and is President of The Palm Spings Preservation Assn). Designed in low-irrigation desert style there is a small grassed area with lemon trees at the rear, fire pit and BBQ. The pool is heated and is totally private.An outdoor covered patio has comfortable seating, also has mountain views and overlooks the pool and gardens.

Dine or enjoy comfortable conversation under the pergola or relax on the huge twin bed sized loungers, all surrounded by lush fauna, 23 palms, fruit trees and statuary with a Zen influence. Feel the breeze and drift away in the sparkling, saltwater pool under the palms. At sunset, soak in the spa with a refreshing cocktail while your favorite music plays through the outdoor speakers. The entire house and backyard is wifi ready and everything is only steps from the pool, spa and waterfall.At night enjoy the fireplace by the pool highlighted by LED pool and spa lights as a backdrop.
